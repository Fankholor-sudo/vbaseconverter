### About the website.

Online-Number-Base-Converter, it converts any number from base 2(binary),8(octal),10(decimal),16(hexadecimal)
to any base in ranging from base-2 to base-36, it also provides all the steps(workings) to the solution.It makes it easier
for you to convert Binary,Decimal,Octal,HexaDecimal,... and understand how it was done!.

### What is Base Conversion..?

In mathematics, a base or radix is the number of different digits or combination of digits and letters that a system of
counting uses to represent numbers. For example, the most common base used today is the decimal(base-10) system
Base Converter is a number Conversion from one base to another. Almost everyone uses
base-10 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} to count, of which is less complicated to use in mathematical arithmetics
like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.But note, we still have other bases that you can use
to do mathematical arithmetics and by practice they can be better to use and be as normal as base-10 is to you.

### What is a Base..?

Base it's a range of all values from 0 to the value that is less than the base with one(base-1)
e.g {0,1,2,3,...,base-1} in this case the base value is excluded, base-10 has all the values less than 10,
Base-5={0,1,2,3,4} has all values strictly less than 5, this means base-2={0,1}, ect...


### How do we present values greater or equal to 10..?

When using bases we are not allowed to repeat values e.g base-14={0,1,2,3,..,10,11,12,13}
this will not be a correct way of presenting values under base14. Consequently Numeral mathematicians
decided to introduce letters in order to accommodate repeating numbers like {A,B,C,...Z} where
A=10,B=11,C=12,..,I=18,...,T=29,...,Z=35. Therefore the correct way of showing
Base-14 = {0,1,2,3,...9,A,B,C,D}. Hope you have realised that having Base-n simply means that we gonna
have n-elements including zero.
Note: You can go as much high as you would love to, as long you won't be repeating values, having in mind that A!=a , B!=a Z!=z etc.
This means Base-72 can have {a,b,c,...z} where a=36, b=37, c=38 and z=71.


### Commonly used Bases

We have 4 stand out Bases{2,8,10.16} where Base-2 is called Binary, Base-8 called Octal ,
Base-10 called Decimal and Base-16 called HexaDecimal which computers use for arithmetics
e.g Computer can only understand Binary(Base2).
Binary numbers are used in giving computer instructions since they can only understand it,
so the name given to the Programming language that only uses Binary numbers is called LowLevel Programming Language
which can be used to develop Softwares and applications.
But LowLevel Programming Language is hard to understand and is too complicated,
so with that being a problem they then introduced high level programming languages like C++, JAVA ,
C# , C , PYTHON , RUBY ,...,ext which made it easier to give a computer instructions with english like words.
